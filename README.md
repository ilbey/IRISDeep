In this project you are required to implement an identity recognition system based on  convolutional neural networks (CNN), and to evaluate it with the provided dataset.

**1. Identity recognition based on iris biometric data** 

The main purpose of the identity recognition systems is to determine the identity of the person in a 
query image. The recognition is done by evaluating semantic contents of the query image.
In a typical practical iris recognition system complete processing chain encompassing initial image 
segmentation, normalisation, feature encoding and the matching steps used to required. However, 
performance of these systems can be degraded very easily with the failure of the segmentation 
stage.

In order to overcome this diffculty iris recognirion can be formulated as a learning problem to match 
an image representation with the identity of person in the eye image. Hence, in this assignment you 
are required to construct a CNN with rectified linear unit (ReLU) as nonlinearity function between 
layers and train it using the provided images.
While training the network you are required to use softmax (cross-entropy loss) function to minimize 
the difference between actual identity and the estimated one.

**2. Database** 

The commercially available data Set 2 (DS2) of the BioSecure Multimodal Database (BMDB) is utilised 
for this project. Four eye images (two left and two right) were acquired in two different sessions with 
a resolution of 640*480 pixels from 200 subjects. Since the left and right eye of an individual is 
completly different. You will consider them as a different individuals. Hence, in this case, database 
will contain 400 subjects each with 4 eye images.
